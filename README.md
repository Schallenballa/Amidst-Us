# Amidst Us
 An in-real-life version of the game, "Among Us."

Amidst Us is a game that can be played with a group of ideally 4+ people. All users will create an account and navigate to the home page. One user will reset the tasks and imposter with the press of a button.

Users will then navigate to the lobby where they will see if they are the imposter or not and what tasks they need to complete.

The in-real-life tasks consist of many different real life activities that they must first complete in person, and then click the button saying that they completed that task.

A global progress bar is shown on all users' screens. Once all of the tasks are sucessfully submitted, the bar will reach 100% completion.

The imposter is playing a different game, however. They are shown a list of all characters that are currently playing. They will have the opportunity to "kill" other players throughout different parts of the game. The goal, however, is to not get caught. Once the imposter is successfully able to "kill" all but one other players, they win the game.

Players are able to report if they have found a "dead body" in real life from when someone was killed. They are also able to call meetings throughout the match.

Players will also be given the opporturnity to vote for who they think the imposter is. If a majority votes for one person, that person is "exiled". If the person that is "exiled" from voting is the imposter, the crewmates win. If the person that is "exiled" from voting is a crewmate, they simply die and the game continues.
